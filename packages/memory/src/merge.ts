- When they disagree, keep both statements and say that they conflict.
- Write in the notes' own language, as Markdown: paragraphs, bullets, \`##\` subheadings and links as the notes write them.
- No images, no HTML, no diagrams and no plugin syntax; no \`<\` right before a letter, \`!\`, \`?\` or \`/\`, even in code. A link's scheme, if it has one, is http, https or mailto. Fence code only as plain text or a common programming language.
- Write the body only: no frontmatter and no title heading (a \`# \` line, or a line of \`=\` under text), since the note keeps its own.
- Answer with JSON only, exactly {"verdict": "merge", "body": "<the merged body>"}: no other key, no code fence, no comment.
